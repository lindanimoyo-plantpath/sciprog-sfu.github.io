#Step 2: give your study group a name and a short description:
title: Scientific Programming Study Group at lindanimoyo-plantpath
description: "A scientific computing study group whose home base is at lindanimoyo-plantpath
University (SFU) in Burnaby, BC, Canada. Our group meets on a weekly basis for peer-
facilitated study-sessions on topics under the broad umbrella of using computers to do
scientific research more effectively and efficiently. This includes using Python for DNA
sequence analysis, plotting and statistical analysis of environmental data in R,
automating repetitive tasks with the shell, general best practices in coding, and to using
tools such as Git and Github to collaborate effectively with others. All are welcome to
this study group, regardless of affiliation or training level."
